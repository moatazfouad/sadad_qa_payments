  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - lib/assets/
    - lib/fonts/
    - lib/fonts/roboto/
  #assets:
  #  - packages/flutter_container_gradient/assets/icons/
  #   - assets/icons/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: "OpenSans"
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: lib/fonts/OpenSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: lib/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: lib/fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
    - family: "roboto"
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: lib/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: lib/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
