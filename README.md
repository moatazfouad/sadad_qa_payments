# SadadPay Flutter

Flutter plugin for Sadad Payment SDK.

## Getting Started

This flutter plugin is a wrapper around our Android and iOS SDKs.

The following documentation is only focused on the wrapper around our flutter Android and iOS SDKs. To know more about our SDKs and how to link them within the projects, refer to the following documentation:


To know more about Sadad payment flow and steps involved, read up here: [https://github.com/SadadDeveloper/Sadad_SDK_Android](https://github.com/SadadDeveloper/Sadad_SDK_Android)

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a Sadad Account and generate the API Keys from the <a href="https://panel.sadad.qa" target="_blank">Sadad Dashboard</a>. Using the Test keys helps simulate a sandbox environment. No actual monetary transaction happens when using the Test keys. Use Live keys once you have thoroughly tested the application and are ready to go live.

## Prerequisites For Google Pay (production only)
- Register your business from  <a href="https://pay.google.com/business/console/" target="_blank">Google Pay</a> Console. For a hassle-free go live process, register the business under the same Google account which is used for your application on Google PlayStore.
- Once the basic regsitration and verification on Google Pay is completed, visit the above link again and go to Google Pay API from the left side menu. You should see your hosted Google Play applications there.
- Click on the Manage button under relevant application to which you want to integrate Google Pay using Sadad Flutter SDK. The application will be in "Not started" state initally.

- Once uploaded submit the application for review by accepting terms and conditions and checking the items in the checlist.
- You will recevie an email from Google Pay once your integration with app is verified. Visit Google Pay business console again from the link mentioned above and on the top right side, you will see your Google Pay merchant ID.
